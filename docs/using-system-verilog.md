# Using System Verilog

You can use System Verilog files your Apio project as you would use Verilog files, simply changes the file extension from `.v` to `.sv` to indicate that they should be handled as System Verilog files. This applies to both synthesizable modules and testbenches.

> It's also ok to mix in the same project both Verilog `.v` files and System Verilog `.sv` files.
