# Apio video tutorial

[Shawn Hymel's](https://shawnhymel.com/) created an excellent videos series with an introduction to FPGA design using Apio 0.95. To view the series on YouTube, click on the video thumbnail below.

<br>

> The Apio 0.6.5 commands used in the video series differ from the current Apio 1.x.x commands but all their functionality was preserved, and even improved. Please see the **[Migrating from Apio 0.x.x]** section in the sidebar for translation of some of these commands.
